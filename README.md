## Overview
YLMassRemove packages a broad set of removal tools in a single module:
- Single-app uninstall flows with deep-clean options
- Stubborn/uncooperative app removal (single and bulk)
- UWP package removal and mass-UWP flows
- Targeted Windows update uninstall and system update helpers
- Mass removal with pipeline support, concurrency, and reporting
- A dynamic help viewer (YL-Help) and full comment-based help for every exported command
- Convenience wrappers and backward-compatible aliases to preserve older scripts

---

## Features
- Deep removal for Win32 and UWP applications
- Stubborn removal tooling:
  - `Stubborn-Uninstall` (single)
  - `MassStubborn-Uninstall` (bulk)
- Mass removal utilities with pipeline input and concurrency (`Mass-Remove`, `MassUWP-Uninstall`)
- Update management:
  - `Uninstall-Update` (targeted update uninstall)
  - `Update-ALL` (update helper)
- Dry-run simulation with `-DryRun` and rich logging
- Per-item and aggregated reporting (CSV / JSON)
- Robust safety flags: `-WhatIf`, `-Confirm`, `-DryRun`, `-Force`
- YL-Help: dynamic, searchable help viewer with examples
- Backward-compatible convenience wrappers and aliases:
  - `rm-app`, `rm-bulk`, `rmhard-app`, `rmhard-bulk`, `rm-uwp`, `rm-uwpbulk`, `ls-progs`, `uptodate`, `yl-hlp32`
- Pipeline friendly and supports ValueFromPipeline where relevant
- Optional concurrency controls for bulk operations
- Exportable logs and reports for auditing

---

## Requirements
- PowerShell 7 or later recommended for Publish-Module and modern module support
- Module metadata targets PowerShell 5.1 for full feature support
- Compatible with Desktop and Core editions of PowerShell
- Administrative privileges are required for deep system changes (uninstalling system-scoped apps, registry sweeps, stopping services, removing drivers)

## Quick installation

Manual (local module folder):
1. Create the module folder in one of the paths listed in `$Env:PSModulePath`, for example:
   - `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\YLMassRemove\`
2. Copy `YLMassRemove.psm1` and `YLMassRemove.psd1` into that folder.
3. Import the module:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module YLMassRemove
   ```
4. Verify:
   ```powershell
   Get-Module YLMassRemove
   ```

Publish to PowerShell Gallery:
- Ensure `PowerShellVersion` in the `.psd1` is `3.0` or higher before calling `Publish-Module`.
- Use `Publish-Module` with a valid API key and follow PowerShell Gallery publishing guidelines.

---

## Persistent aliases
To make convenient aliases available across sessions, add alias lines to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`):

```powershell
# Example to persist aliases
Set-Alias -Name rm-app -Value App-Uninstall -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name rm-bulk -Value Mass-Remove -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name rmhard-app -Value Stubborn-Uninstall -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name rmhard-bulk -Value MassStubborn-Uninstall -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name ls-progs -Value List-Apps -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name uptodate -Value Update-ALL -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name yl-hlp32 -Value TL-Help -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name rm-uwp -Value UWP-Uninstall -Scope Global
Set-Alias -Name rm-uwpbulk -Value MassUWP-Uninstall -Scope Global

```

Open your profile to edit:
```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```
Paste desired `Set-Alias` lines, save, and restart PowerShell.

## Usage and examples

Basic listing:
```powershell
# List apps with a filter and include UWP packages
List-Apps -Filter "Zoom" -IncludeUWP
```

Single stubborn uninstall:
```powershell
# Direct cmdlet
Stubborn-Uninstall -Name "McAfee" -KillProcesses -DeepClean -Force

# Convenience wrapper (alias)
rmhard-app -Name "McAfee" -KillProcesses -DeepClean -Force
```

Bulk stubborn uninstall (pipeline-friendly):
```powershell
# Direct
"McAfee","Zoom" | MassStubborn-Uninstall -KillProcesses -DeepClean -Force

# Alias
"McAfee","Zoom" | rmhard-bulk -KillProcesses -DeepClean -Force
```

Mass removal simulation and export:
```powershell
Get-Content apps.txt | rm-bulk -DryRun | Export-Csv removed-sim.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

Uninstall a Windows update:
```powershell
Uninstall-Update -KB "KB5000802" -WhatIf
```

View built-in help with dynamic viewer:
```powershell
YL-Help -Name Stubborn-Uninstall
# or using alias if configured
usage
```

Concurrency example (if supported by your environment):
```powershell
"App1","App2","App3" | Mass-Remove -Concurrency 4 -DryRun
```

## Logging, dry-run, and reports
- Use `-DryRun` to simulate actions without making changes; output supports CSV/JSON for auditing.
- Logging levels: informational, verbose, warning, error. Use `-Verbose` and `-Debug` for more output.
- Per-item logs can be written to a directory using `-LogPath`.
- Bulk operations optionally aggregate results into a summary report with counts, success/fail lists, and error messages.

Example report export:
```powershell
Mass-Remove -InputObject (Get-Content apps.txt) -DryRun -ExportCsv "removal-sim.csv"
```

---

## Safety and permissions
- Use `-WhatIf` and `-DryRun` liberally before running destructive operations.
- `-Confirm` and `-Force` are supported where applicable.
- Administrative rights are required for many operations; run PowerShell as Administrator when performing system-wide removals.
- The module exposes deep-clean and registry-sweeping optionsâ€”double-check targets before running.

Local development tips:
- Run functions in a development session by dot-sourcing the `.psm1`:
  ```powershell
  . .\YLMassRemove.psm1
  ```
- Use `-WhatIf`/`-DryRun` in tests to avoid destructive changes
- Keep wrappers and aliases consistent with exported function names
